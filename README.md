# Prediction and detection of epileptic seizures
## Machine Learning Course

Objectives of the project:

1- To build, train and test multilayer networks for classification of big data sets. 
2- To build, train and test dynamic neural networks (with delays) for 
multidimensional time series prediction. 
3- To face the problem of feature reduction with autoencoders. 
4- To configure, train and test Convolutional Neural Networks for multiclass 
classification (deep learning). 
5- To configure, train and test LSTM (Long Short Time Memory Neural Networks) 
for multidimensional time series classification.
